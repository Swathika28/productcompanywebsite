              An online game is a video game that is either partially or 
              primarily played through the Internet or any other computer network available.
              Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming platforms, including PCs, consoles
              and mobile devices, and span many genres, including first-person shooters, 
              strategy games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG).
              In 2019, revenue in the online games segment reached $16.9 billion, 
              with $4.2 billion generated by China and $3.5 billion in the United States.
              Since 2010s, a common trend among online games has been operating them as 
              games as a service, using monetization schemes such as loot boxes and
              battle passes as purchasable items atop freely-offered games.
              Unlike purchased retail games, online games have the problem of
              not being permanently playable, as they require special servers in order to function.

              The design of online games can range from simple text-based environments to the
              incorporation of complex graphics and virtual worlds.The existence of 
              online components within a game can range from being minor features, such as an
              online leaderboard, to being part of core gameplay, such as directly playing 
              against other players. Many online games create their own online communities, 
              while other games, especially social games, integrate the players' existing 
              real-life communities.Some online games can receive a 
              massive influx of popularity due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing them.
